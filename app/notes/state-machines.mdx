State is just data that changes over time

## Global state

State can change at any time for any reason

## Reducer pattern

State is only changed by events.

## State machines

State is only changed by specific events when in specific states that support those actions

```js
const simpleMachine = {
  initial: 'active',
  states: {
    active: { on: { TOGGLE: 'inactive' } },
    inactive: { on: { TOGGLE: 'active' } },
  }
}

const reducer = (state, event) => {
  return simpleMachine.states[state].on?[event.type] ?? state;
}

// in your component
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, machine.initial);
```
