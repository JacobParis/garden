> Company: We can’t see our way to $88,000.

> * Micro-tip: “Interesting” is a wonderful word: it is positive and non-commital at the same time.  If they tell you a number, tell them it is an “interesting” number, not a “wonderful” number.

> Express sympathy with him, because he just said he wants to give you more but can’t, then refocus the discussion on things which are within his personal authority.  You can then use the unspent “You wanted to do something nice for me” obligation which he just acknowledged on one of the things which he has authority to grant you.
