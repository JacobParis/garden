## Non-semantic elements

There are only 5 non-semantic elements in HTML. They don't imply any particular meaning about their content, so their only purpose is the CSS styles that browsers apply by default.

Non-semantic elements can be used for almost all situations, but `<div>` and `<span>` are by far the most common.

`<div>` elements have `display: block;` by default
`<span>` elements have `display: inline;` by default
`<pre>` elements have `display:block; white-space: pre; font-family: monospace;` by default
`<sub>` elements have `vertical-align: sub;` by default
`<sup>` elements have `vertical-align: sup;` by default


## Inline vs block

Inline elements flow like text. You can wrap text in inline tags like span and it will not affect its flow at all. Two inline elements will appear side by side.

Block elements stack (like blocks). By default, block elements fill the width of the screen. Two block elements will appear top and bottom.

To use a table analogy, consider inline elements like columns and block elements like rows.

## Semantic elements

Semantic elements tell a browser what your content means.

It is better to use non-semantic elements (like <div> and <span>) than the wrong semantic elements.

## Lists

There are several ways of writing lists in html.

The `<ol>` tag is for ordered lists. They are usually numbered sequentially.
The `<ul>` tag is for unordered lists. They're usually displayed with bullet points.

The only element that's allowed to be inside these lists is `<li>`

When a screen reader reads this element, it will say "List, 3 items"

```html
<ul>
  <li> Apple </li>
  <li> Banana </li>
  <li> Cherry </li>
</ul>
```

If you have a list with no elements, the screen reader will still read out "List, 0 items". If you don't want that, make sure you remove the `<ul>` tags on empty lists too.

If you're displaying a list and hiding the bullet points so that it doesn't visually look like a list, consider whether a screen reader should still call it a list. If not, then you are probably better off not using a list element. 

## Navigation lists

The `<nav>` tag is for lists of links.

Not every link needs to be in a `<nav>` tag, but if the user is expected to use the links as the main way to get to different parts of the page (or other pages), then you should probably use a `<nav>` tag

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/home"> Home </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/blog"> Blog </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Note that the `<nav>` must still have list elements like `<ul>`, and each link is still wrapped with `<li>`

It's ok to have multiple `<nav>` tags on the page. If you have a sidebar with links to your blog posts, and each blog post has a table of contents linking to different sections of the post, both of those should be wrapped in `<nav>` tags

On the other hand, it's common for site footers to be filled with various links. Since these are not a primary method of navigation, no `<nav>` tag is needed.

## Description lists

The `<dl>` tag is for description lists. These are useful when you want to show information that has both a **term** and a **definition**

While `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags can only have `<li>` elements as children, `<dl>` tags have `<dt>`(description term) and `<dd>` (description definition) elements

It's also ok for description lists to have `<div>` tags as children, but only for presentational reasons.

```html
<dl>
  <dt> Property type </dt>
  <dd> House </dd>

  <dt> Price </dt>
  <dd> $145,000 </dd>

  <dt> Bedrooms </dt>
  <dd> 3 </dd>
</dl>
```

A `<dt>` term is defined by the nearest next `<dd>` definition. If multiple terms have the same definition, they can share a `<dd>` tag

```html
<dl>
  <dt> Peach </dt>
  <dt> Nectarine </dt>
  <dd> A pale orange stonefruit </dd>

  <dt> Banana </dt>
  <dd> A large yellow berry </dd>
</dl>
```

## Headings

HTML has six heading tags, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, used to mark headings on a page.

Do not use heading tags just to change font sizes.

You can only have one `<h1>` tag per page.

## Element with optional closing tags

Several HTML elements do not require closing tags

- `<html>`
- `<head>
- `<body>`
- `<p>`
- `<dt>`
- `<dd>`
- `<li>`
- `<option>`
- `<th>`
- `<tbody>`
- `<tr>`
- `<td>`
- `<tfoot>
- `<colgroup>`

That means that this is valid html

```html
<html>
  <head> <title> My blog </title>
  <body>
    <h1> My blog </h1>

    <p> Welcome to my blog
    <p> Here are a list of my posts

    <ul>
      <li> My first post
      <li> My second post
      <li> My third post
    </ul>
```

As a general rule I don't recommend writing html like this, as it can be hard to tell when an element is meant to end or meant to nest, especially when the formatting isn't as clean as possible.

## Elements with no closing tags

HTML has several **void** elements.

- `<br>`
- `<hr>`
- `<img>`
- `<input>`
- `<link>`
- `<meta>`
- `<area>`
- `<base>`
- `<col>`
- `<embed>`
- `<param>`
- `<source>`
- `<track>`

These cannot have any content, and cannot have separate closing tags. Closing a void element like this is invalid html.

```html
<img alt="" src=""></img>
```

Void elements can optionally be self-closing, so these are both correct.

```html
<img alt="" src="">

<img alt="" src="" />
```
