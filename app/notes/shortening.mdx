Shortening is any fat that shortens the fibres of the dough, making it crumblier

Normally you cut it into the dough in small pieces that remain intact until they can melt in the oven. When adding shortening to flour, a liquid oil will form the ideal tiny flour covered ball automatically and improves as it's worked, while solid shortenings need to be cut into the flour and carefully worked as little as possible, lest it clump together
