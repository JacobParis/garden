export const title = 'GZIP'

* first indication of gzip working in chrome devtools: the network transferred is lower than the actual resources size

* second indication: hover on the size and it will show you the size transferred, vs the actual size of the file. if transferred is less than actual size, compression is happening here

just in case you are doing your own web sever or local development in the future, note that brotli will only work in HTTPS, whereas gzip can work in HTTP only
so if you are testing http://localhost/ in your own local dev, you won't be able to confirm your brotli configuration is working unless you do a local self-signed cert
just an info in case you are dealing with your own web server in the future
if you are using 3rd party ones, they'll do the things for you so you odn't have to bother :slight_smile:
