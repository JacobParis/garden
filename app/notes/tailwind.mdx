export const title = 'Tailwind'

Tailwind is a utility first css library

While at first glance utility classes appear to be identical to inline styling, tailwind offers media query classes `md:text-center`, which is impossible with inline styles.

Some css patterns made of multiple rules are a single tailwind class, like `.inset-0` which maps to

```css
.inset-0 {
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

Tailwind itself is strictly CSS. Bootstrap comes with loads of javascript components, but Tailwind UI components are just html with classes pre-applied 

## Configuration

The Tailwind command line can initialize a new Tailwind config file. After running this command, Tailwind generates what is essentially a gigantic javascript object containing values for colors, spacing, scales, and more.

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/tailwind init tailwind.config.js
```

Since this file contains all the defaults, generating it won't be any different from not generating it, until you start to modify it.
