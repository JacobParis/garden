export const title = 'Tailwind'

Tailwind is a utility first css library

While at first glance utility classes appear to be identical to inline styling, tailwind offers media query classes `md:text-center`, which is impossible with inline styles.

Some css patterns made of multiple rules are a single tailwind class, like `.inset-0` which maps to

```css
.inset-0 {
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

Tailwind itself is strictly CSS. Bootstrap comes with loads of javascript components, but Tailwind UI components are just html with classes pre-applied
