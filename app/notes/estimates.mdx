export const title = 'Estimates'

> I recommend treating estimates as budgets, so instead of saying, “This task will take 2–3 days”, try saying, “We can afford/justify spending 2–3 days on this task.”

> If you always knew that this task would cost 2 weeks, would you have invested in it anyway? If you would have felt good about the outcome anyway, then don’t let one programmer’s overly-optimistic guess stop you from feeling good about it!
