export const title = "React components"

By mapping over the children of a component, you can pass props down to them

You can assemble an allow-list of specific subcomponents to pass data to, while leaving foreign children untouched

```js
const allowedTypes = [ToggleOn, ToggleOff, ToggleButton]

return React.Children.map((child) => {
  if (allowedTypes.includes(child.type)) {
    return React.cloneElement(child, props)
  }

  return child
})
```
