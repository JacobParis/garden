export const title = 'React context'

Context is for sharing state between tightly coupled components. Often lifting state is preferable to sharing state.

To create:
```js
const Context = React.createContext()

ReactDOM.render(
  <Context.Provider value="This is the context">
    <App />
  </Context.Provider>
)
```

To use inside a component:
```js
const context = React.useContext(Context)
```

It's a good idea to throw an error manually when context is being used outside of its provider
