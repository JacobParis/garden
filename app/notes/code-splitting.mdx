In DevTools, open the Network tab and then open the secondary "Coverage" menu to see how much of each file is actually being used by the page.

Use dynamic imports to lazy load components
Wrap dynamic imports in React.lazy to make Suspense boundaries catch them
```diff
- import Component from './component'
+ const Component = React.lazy(() => import('./component'))
```
```diff
+ <React.Suspense fallback={Spinner}>
    <Component />
+ </React.Suspense>
```

Calling `import('./component')` before you want to use it will begin its loading process. Trigger that from a callback as soon as you discover user intent to display a component and it will be ready to go with no visible loading time.

To begin loading a component after the page loads but without any manual triggering, the magic comment `webpackPrefetch` will do that.
```js
import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ './component')
```
