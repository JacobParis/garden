export const title = 'Baking powder'

Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda (a powdered base) and cream of tartar (a powdered acid). Since it's a solid, the chemical reaction doesn't start until water is added.

Recipes that include baking soda will also include an acid of some sort, often buttermilk. In those recipes there is a very small time window after mixing to begin cooking.
