This is explained in the course but to give a quick overview: Testing has tradeoffs. When tests pass or fail, that has implications over your system
If you make a change that breaks your application's functionality, but the tests keep passing, that's a false positive
If you make a change that is inconsequential, but but the tests start failing, that's a false negative
A big part of what Testing Library aims to solve is eliminating false negatives: that is, you build resilient tests that allow you to refactor your code without breaking the tests
So if I have a regular input, and I want to swap that out for a CurrencyInput component that has dollar sign formatting, or maybe we want to move it somewhere else in the form
As long as it's accessible and the label is roughly accurate, then getByRole('textbox', { name: /name/i }) is going to find the input
Whether it's called name or username or display name or first name
Now if you just had a testid on there, and its label was changed to password or to email, your test would keep passing: false positive (because a user isn't going to be able to fill the form correctly)
Or you copy/paste that chunk of form to another page to rename a bunch because there's another similarly styled form
