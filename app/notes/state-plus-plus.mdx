export const title = "State++"

## Question

There are no errors, but the state doesn't change when I trigger the action
```js
const counter = (state = 0, action)=>{
    switch(action.type){
      case "INCREMENT"  :
        return state++;
      case "DECREMENT":
        return state--;
  
        default:
          return state
    }
  }

export default counter
```

## Answer

Try a thing for me
```diff
const counter = (state = 0, action)=>{
    switch(action.type){
      case "INCREMENT"  :
-       return state++;
+       return state + 1;
      case "DECREMENT":
-       return state--;
+       return state - 1;
  
      default:
        return state
    }
  }
```
the `++ ` and `--` unary operators are not recommended for a number of reasons. 
  0. They mutate the value
  0. If you chain them, it can be hard to know which variable they apply to.
  0. And most importantly: It's not super grokkable whether you're **incrementing and then returning** or **returning then incrementing**

The latter point is, in fact, the difference between `++state`  and `state++`
I suspect that replacing replacing yours with `++state`  and `--state`  will solve it for you, but I recommend using neither and instead just + or - 1
