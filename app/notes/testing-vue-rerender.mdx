It's called updateProps in vue
```js
const { updateProps } = render()
await updateProps(props)
```

It's an alias for vue test utils setProps, so I don't know for sure why they didn't rename it to rerender if they're changing it anyway
but maybe render in vue isn't quite the same metaphor as it is with react


> one more question... is it bad idea to test if custom event is emitted? is that like testing implementation details?


That depends what you're testing


> Im testing pagination component and all it does is to emit custom event


If you're building a reusable component and you want that component to be tested in isolation, then you should test that it emits the correct events because that's part of the API


> so in this case it should be fine?


But if that component is just inside your application and it isn't going to be part of a library, you can get the same code coverage just by making sure it works without testing implementation details

> ye I hear ya


Not 100% sure the vue implementation, but in React I do this by passing a callback that's listening for that event in my test
```js
test() {
  let response = null
  render(<Button onClick={event => response = event} />)
  expect(response).toBe(true)
}
```

> so I just checked source code... they export emitted as well
```js
 it('should fire prevPage event on click', async () => {
   const { emitted } = render(Pagination, { router, store, props });
 
   const prevPage = screen.getByRole('button', {
     name: /prevpage/i,
   });
 
   await userEvent.click(prevPage);
 
   expect(emitted()['prevPage']).toBeTruthy();
 });
```
