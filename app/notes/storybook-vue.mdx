export const title = 'Storybook Vue'

A Story is a function that returns a Vue Component

Since Javascript functions are objects, a function can have properties. Storybook uses these properties for extra data, such as arguments and decorators, that it uses to create the story.

```js
function Component() {
  return {
    props: {},
    data() {},
    template: `<p> Hello world </p>`,
    computed: {},
    methods: {}
  }
}
Component.args = {}
Component.decorators = []
```

Note that these extra fields are part of the Component function itself, not part of the object it returns.
