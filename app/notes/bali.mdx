## The visa

You need a visa to get into Bali. The best option right now is the business e-visa, where a company in Bali sponsors you to come out for 'commerce and business discussions'. The going rate is approximately 8,500,000 IDR and it takes a few days to process.

The visa allows you to stay for 2 months, followed by up to 4 extensions at $50 apiece for a total of 6 months on the island.

Covid insurance is mandatory. Safetywing is a little more than $10/week and can be set up in minutes.

## The flights

All flights to Bali now route through Jakarta, where you're required to submit a PCR test. Upon landing in Bali, you're required to submit another PCR test that was taken within the prior 24 hours. This timing is almost impossible (given the length of flights and the likelihood of layovers) so the recommendation is to plan to stay in Jakarta for a day and get the second swab test there.

## Where to stay

The best snorkeling is in the northeast and then the west. Amed is top spot, but there's no nomad community there.

Conversely, Canggu remains the top spot for nomads, but there's no snorkeling there. A shame.

## Scooters

Scooters are colloquially mandatory in Bali. Walking from place to place is unsafe with no sidewalks, so most people get around on scooters.
