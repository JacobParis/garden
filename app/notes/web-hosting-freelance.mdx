Look up "web hosting {area}" to find web host competitors. Make a list of them

For each competitor in the list, look up "by {competitor}" to find a list of sites who have credited that hosting provider in their footer. These are their customers. Make a list of them and note which host they're using.

Do an IP lookup on each of the sites to get the IP of their host server, and then do a reverse IP lookup on that IP to get a list of other sites on that host. Add those to the list under each host. You now have a list of leads to target your services to.

Go online and look at reviews for each of your competitors. Note every complaint, and use that to tailor your marketing messages. If they complain about after hours service, advertise that as a selling point for yourself. Reach out to them by targeting their pain points (reliability, speed, etc)
