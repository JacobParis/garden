export const title = 'Package lock'

> 1. If you update the version of a package (npm i my-package) then both package.json and package-lock.json are updated.
> 
> 2. If you don't update packages, but run rm -rf node_modules && npm i, package.json stays the same, package-lock.json is updated.
> 
> The contents of package-lock.json can differ based on the version of npm used. So it can happen that 2. updates the package-lock.json, even though no packages have been updated. Most devs, won't commit the package-lock.json, but some do.
> 
> 3. Running npm i reads package & version data from package.json, and can update package-lock.
> 
> 4. Running npm ci ignores package.json , removes node_modules, and installs packages & versions read from package-lock.json
