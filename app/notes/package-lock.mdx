> 1. If you update the version of a package (npm i my-package) then both package.json and package-lock.json are updated.
> 
> 2. If you don't update packages, but run rm -rf node_modules && npm i, package.json stays the same, package-lock.json is updated.
> 
> The contents of package-lock.json can differ based on the version of npm used. So it can happen that 2. updates the package-lock.json, even though no packages have been updated. Most devs, won't commit the package-lock.json, but some do.

> 3. Running npm i reads package & version data from package.json, and can update package-lock.

Installing using different npm versions can create different package lock files because of differences in the way they've historically handled SSL. An old version might generate some http while a newer one generates https urls for the same package version

Package-lock can update without updating package.json if a new package version is released that still matches the version range specified

- `latest`
- `^2.16.4` means anything minor or patch later than that (but not 3.x)
