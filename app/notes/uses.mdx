# Computer

* Early 2011 Macbook Pro - with 8GB RAM and a 128GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD. Considering swapping out the disk drive with another storage disk

* Early 2019 Macbook Pro - this is my work machine. There's a [minor flashing issue](https://twitter.com/jacobmparis/status/1264612711830360065?s=20) on the touchbar when it goes into standby, but nothing that's impacted my functionality.

* Apple Magic keyboard

* Apple Magic trackpad

* [Twelve South Magic Bridge](https://www.amazon.ca/Twelve-South-MagicBridge-Connects-Trackpad/dp/B01N9D63YE?tag=jacobparis-20) â€“ This bridge keeps the keyboard and trackpad acting like a single unit which is great for sitting on the lap or working off the couch streaming from the TV
