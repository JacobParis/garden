export const title = "Tenancy in common"

**Tenancy in common** is a condo-like designation that distinguishes itself from regular condos by being even worse

A collateral mortgage is where one person signs a mortgage against multiple properties to give to one bank
A TIC is where multiple people sign multiple mortgages against one property to give to one of the two banks that are willing to put up with them.

Everyone in the building owns a percentage share of the property, which means everyone in the building is a de-facto guarantor to everyone else's mortgage. It also means everyone in the building is personally liable when someone decides to sue the building instead of burning it.

If you're lucky enough to make it into the condo-conversion lottery, you can pay money to turn your TIC into a regular condo that's worth much more money. Doing that has unlimited upside with the exception of the limit that you can't convert it while your old mortgages hold the TIC as collateral. 

> Anyway, you now have to approach a bank and say "hey, I need a mortgage on this condo". The bank looks at public records and says "it's not a condo, it's a TIC" and you say "right, it can't finish become a condo until you give me a mortgage". The bank then says "but we can't give a mortgage until it is already a condo" and then the bank divides by zero and reboots and you try another bank, and they all do this until you accidentally find somebody who works at a bank who lives in SF and has therefore heard of TICs.
