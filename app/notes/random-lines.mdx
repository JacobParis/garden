export const title = 'Random lines'

```js
const lines = [
  'once upon a midnight dreary',
  'while I pondered weak and weary',
  'over many a quaint and curious',
  'volume of forgotten lore'
]

function sample(array) {
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)

  return array[randomIndex]
}
```

```js
console.log(sample(lines))
// "while I pondered weak and weary"
```

If your question is how to load the lines from separate text file, the EASIEST way is to instead make that a javascript module

`lines.js` (notice the quotes here on the first and last lines are backticks not apostrophes)
```js
module.exports = `
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”
`
``` 

And then you import it into your file that sends the messages
```js
const lines = require('./lines.js')
  .split("\n") // Split into an array on each newline
  .map(line => line.trim()) // Remove space from start and end of line
  .filter(Boolean) // Remove empty lines
```
