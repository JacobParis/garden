```
3 tsp baking powder
2 cups flour
1 tsp salt
1/3 cup oil (I use corn, probably anything works)
2/3 cup milk
```

Mix everything dry together, whisk around, drizzle oil while whisking until it looks consistent again. If youâ€™re adding cheese or chives or anything do that now

Add milk and mix just until it starts to resemble a dough, then either do drop biscuits or roll out to 1cm thick and cut out shapes. I use a mason jar lid as a cookie cutter

Put on oiled cookie sheet or parchment paper at 350 for roughly 20 minutes
