export const title = 'Trying to skip dependencies'

# Question

I want this effect to run only when cardData changes but if i pass retrial as dependency it runs on every change of retrial count which is not what i want

```js
const CardSwipe = () => {
    const [retrials, setRetrials] = useState(0)
    const cardData = useCardState()

    useEffect(() => {
        //request only if card is not valid and retrials are less than 3
        
       if(cardData.isNotValid && retrials < 3){
            requestNewCard() // this enables the cardReader asking cutomer to swipe/insert
            setRetrials(c => c + 1 )
        } else {
            //card is Valid send to authorization page
            history.push("/authPage")
        }

    }, [cardData]) // So can i exclude 'retrials' here ??

    if (retrials >= 3) return (<h1>Some Error Msg</h1>)

    return (
        <h1> Please swipe/insert your card</h1>
    )
}
```

# Answer

The problem is that what you want isn't being accurately described by state

There are some times when cardData is not valid and retrial is less than 3 where you do want it to request a new card, and there are times when those are true and you don't. That means there isn't enough information for React to work

The easy way is make a new boolean that tracks whether you've checked the result or not. Only grab a new card if you've checked the current one and then set it to false after.

```diff
    useEffect(() => {
        //request only if card is not valid and retrials are less than 3
        
       if(cardData.isNotValid && cardData.hasChecked && retrial < 3){
            requestNewCard() // this enables the cardReader asking cutomer to swipe/insert
+           cardData.hasChecked = false
            setRetrials(c => c + 1 )
        } else {
            //card is Valid send to authorization page
            history.push("/authPage")
        }
-    }, [cardData]) // So can i exclude 'retrial' here ??
+    }, [cardData.isNotValid, cardData.hasChecked, retrial])
```

A better way would be to use a state enum, so instead of cardData.isNotValid which can only be true or false, you have cardData.state which can be IDLE, VALID, or INVALID (possibly PENDING if it's async)

```js
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (cardData.state === 'INVALID' && retrial < 3) {
    requestNewCard()

    setRetrials(retrial => retrial + 1)
    setCardState('IDLE')
  }

  if (cardData.state === 'VALID') {
    history.push('/authPage')
  }
}, [cardData.state, retrial])
```
