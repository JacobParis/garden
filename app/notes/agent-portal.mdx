## ~Authentication was broken~

There were some updates needed to fix the Cognito setup and lack of SSR

## Editing items should autosave with revert button
*From matt* 
> My preference would be autosave, with the card header and done button as a sticky element that cannot be scrolled offscreen when in edit mode.

There are a number of different patterns for editing and saving cards currently in place. This is largely because of matt changing  opinions during the design process, as new information came in about how people were using the software, and about the common mistakes they ended up making. 

The most common method in place i sthe save/cancel process. Each card has an edit mode and a static mode. By default, they're in the static mode which makes it easy to view the information. Upon pressing edit, you go into edit. This will not change. 

Once in edit mode, changes are temporary. By hitting cancel, they're discarded and  by pressing Savce they are committed to the database for permanence.

On particularly long cards, the save button will be off-screen either on the top or bottom (depending where we decide to put the button) or even on both if the card is exceptionally long. This means the user editing information will not see the save button, and has no reason to suspect their changes aren't being saved.

Saving automatically has its own problems too: a user who clears or changes a field by mistake might forget what the original content was. There is a need for a solution that solves this too.

The current plan is to replace the save/cancel buttons with done/discard buttons, and have each input autosave on blur.

### Attempt 1) Map into existing store structure
There's already a save card function, so I'll clone it and call it saveField since this one is meant to be fired on every field. If it ends up being the same, I can merge it back in, but this way my changes don't break anything else.

We can use a state enum called cardState which is either IDLE, SAVING, or SAVED (for now)

```js
async function saveField() {
  if (this.cardState === 'IDLE' || this.cardState === 'SAVED') {
    this.cardState = 'SAVING'
    await this.$store.dispatch(`${store}/upsertSection`, {
      id: this.id,
      section: this.section,
    })

    this.cardState = 'SAVED'
  }
},
```

This implementation is naïve and will ignore overlapping saves. That means if one field hasn't finished autosaving by the time another one tries, it will skip that one. It's a small bug, but one to be sorted out later.

Adding `@blur="saveField"` to the input and it works great – successfully saved on every blur after every change.

Touching an input and then leaving it immediately also forces a save, so it's necessary to check whether the input has changed since the last time it was saved. For that I'll add a new state variable called `savedSection` that represents the section's values as they existed the last time they were saved. We also need to start passing in the name of the field so we know which one to check

```diff
async function saveField(fieldName) {
+ // If no fieldName is passed, skip this check and attempt to save
+ if (this.savedSection && fieldName) {
+   // We don't need to save the field if it hasn't changed since last time
+   const isUnchanged =
+     this.savedSection[fieldName] === this.section[fieldName]
+   if (isUnchanged) return
+ }
  
  if (this.cardState === 'IDLE' || this.cardState === 'SAVED') {
    this.cardState = 'SAVING'
    await this.$store.dispatch(`${store}/upsertSection`, {
      id: this.id,
      section: this.section,
    })

    this.cardState = 'SAVED'
    this.savedSection = { ...this.section }
  }
},
```

As long as the savedSection is updated when edit or save is clicked, and then nullified when cancel is clicked, this works great for all top level fields.

For nested data, we'd need to pass a sort of path to the value either as a string (vuex map fields style) or a getter function (section => section.whatever.nested)
### Method 2: Apollo

To move data from vuex to apollo we first look at the getters on the page
```js
...mapGetters('mortgages', ['mortgageTotal', 'refinancedMortgagesAmount']),
```

Copy them into the file you're working on and refactor to be named functions (not methods, which they were before)
```js
function mortgageTotal(state) {
  return state.sections.reduce(
    (sum, mortgage) => sum + Number(mortgage.balance),
    0,
  )
}

function refinancedMortgagesAmount(state) {
  return state.sections
    .filter((mortgage) => mortgage.refinanced)
    .reduce((sum, mortgage) => sum + Number(mortgage.balance), 0)
}
```

Replace `state.sections` with the path into whichever object you're working with. For a liability getter, this is as easy as `deal.liabilities`. Mortgages are the weird case, because they're a subfield of both subject and owned properties, and we need to inject the property ID into each. For help, go to `store/index.js` and look at the function that calls `mortgageToStore`. That will show you what maps into `state.sections`.

For mortgages that's this whole mess
```js
commit(
  'mortgages/setSections',
  Array()
    .concat(deal.subjectProperties, deal.otherProperties)
    .flatMap((property) =>
      property.activeMortgages.map((mortgage) => ({
        propertyId: property.id,
        ...mortgage,
      })),
    )
    .map(mortgageToStore),
)
```

Here it makes sense to make a special function just for finding the mortgages that the others can use
```js
function mortgages(deal) {
  return Array()
    .concat(deal.subjectProperties, deal.otherProperties)
    .flatMap((property) =>
      property.activeMortgages.map((mortgage) => ({
        propertyId: property.id,
        ...mortgage,
      })),
    )
}
```

And state.sections can be replaced by calls to that
```js
function mortgageTotal(deal) {
  return mortgages(deal)
    .reduce((sum, mortgage) => sum + Number(mortgage.balance), 0)
}

function refinancedMortgagesAmount(deal) {
  return mortgages(deal)
    .filter((mortgage) => mortgage.refinanced)
    .reduce((sum, mortgage) => sum + Number(mortgage.balance), 0)
}
```

Next, check mortgageToStore to see how each of the properties are supposed to be mapped. Here, that's `mortgage.balance` and `mortgage.refinanced`. In this case those are straight 1:1 maps, so the getter is good as-is, but we'll need be pasting those fields into our GraphQL query that we're writing now.

A sample query for liabilities that just needs `liability.refinanced`, `liability.PayoffType`, and `liability.amount`
```js
const LIABILITIES_QUERY = gql`
  query($id: ID!) {
    deal(_id: $id) {
      id: _id # All queries must return deal id so the cache works
      liabilities {
        id
        refinanced
        PayoffType
        amount
      }
    }
  }
`
```

If you need something to reference, check the oversized deal query in `store/index.js`

The mortgage query is going to look like this, since there are only two fields we need

```js
const MORTGAGES_QUERY = gql`
  query($id: ID!) {
    deal(_id: $id) {
      id: _id # All queries must return deal id so the cache works
      subjectProperties {
        id
        activeMortgages {
          id
          refinanced
          balance
        }
      }
      otherProperties {
        id
        activeMortgages {
          id
          refinanced
          balance
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

And we can make vue-apollo call that natively. I've highlighted things that are specific to this query. The getters from the beginning of the process need to be mapped in the update() function. Apollo will give us two new state variables `this.mortgages.mortgageTotal` and `this.mortgages.refinancedMortgagesAmount`, which are meant to replace the mapGetters function.

```diff
apollo: {
  mortgages: {
      // Don't try and look up a non-existent new deal
      skip: ({ $route }) => $route.params.id === 'new',
      
+     query: MORTGAGES_QUERY,
      
      update({ deal }) {
        return {
+         mortgageTotal: mortgageTotal(deal),
+         refinancedMortgagesAmount: refinancedMortgagesAmount(deal),
        }
      },
      
      variables() {
        return {
          id: this.$route.params.id,
        }
      },
    },
  }
}
```

Only three things left to do. 
- Replace every call to `this.mortgageTotal` with `this.mortgages.mortgageTotal` since it's namespaced now. Don't forget about any `{{ mortgageTotal }}` calls in the template, or about any of the other getters.
- Delete the mapGetters line since nothing uses it anymore
- Add a default value for mortgages to our data() object that Vue can use before our query completes.
```diff
data() {
  return {
    subjectProperties: {},
    borrowers: {},
    liabilities: {},
+   mortgages: {},
  }
},
```



## Opening some deals goes to broken "new deal" page

Most likely some deal mapping things with incomplete data.

## No deal pagination

We can steal this from the lead admin portal since it's almost identically built

## Unqualified leads with negative loan balances are mixed in the same list

## Credit score modal uses hardcoded name Andrew Smith

## Valuation sources show MPAC

## Names on dashboard end in X?

## Deal page property details age shows '-- years' when no age

## Lender logo name prop doesn't handle null lenders

## Intake sidebar prints out array of names instead of joining them

> Meet with [ "Jacob Paris" ]

# Things to delete

None of these do anything at the moment, so we can kill them and either add back later, implementing each properly one by one or learn that we were better off without them all along
