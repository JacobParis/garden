## ~Authentication was broken~

There were some updates needed to fix the Cognito setup and lack of SSR

## Editing items should autosave with revert button
*From matt* 
> My preference would be autosave, with the card header and done button as a sticky element that cannot be scrolled offscreen when in edit mode.

I would prefer to handle this myself since I have the most context

## Opening some deals goes to broken "new deal" page

Most likely some deal mapping things with incomplete data.

## No deal pagination

We can steal this from the lead admin portal since it's almost identically built

## Unqualified leads with negative loan balances are mixed in the same list

## Credit score modal uses hardcoded name Andrew Smith

## Valuation sources show MPAC

## Names on dashboard end in X?

## Deal page property details age shows '-- years' when no age

## Lender logo name prop doesn't handle null lenders

## Intake sidebar prints out array of names instead of joining them

> Meet with [ "Jacob Paris" ]

# Things to delete

None of these do anything at the moment, so we can kill them and either add back later, implementing each properly one by one or learn that we were better off without them all along
