Tackle your finances in this order:

Debt
Savings
Investments

Pay off all your debts that are greater than 10% APR. 

Holding a credit card balance month over month does not improve your credit score.

If you pay off your card each month, you never pay interest and you'll still report utilized credit for your score.

If you have too much credit card debt to pay off, most banks offer zero interest cards for 6 months in exchange for a 2% transfer fee

Secured debt has a lower interest rate than unsecured debt, so if you can consolidate into your car payment or mortgage, do that.

Save a few months liquid cash. It's up to you how much, but if you get fired or there's an emergency, you need to be able to make ends meet.

Do this before trying to invest your money. It's important to be able to withdraw at any time.

Start contributing to an 401k/RRSP *or* an IRA/TFSA

Which first?

* If your employer will match 401k/RRSP contributions, do that immediately. It's free money.

* If you plan on being in a lower tax bracket when you retire, start with 401k/RRSP

* Otherwise, IRA/TFSA

Both of those have contribution limits. If you max out one, move to the other.

Max out both, and you can spend what's left on anything you want

Investments and debt are two sides to the same coin. 

Paying off a debt at 6% interest has the same upside as investing in something that returns 6%. 

If you borrow against a house at 3% interest, and invest that in an index fund that's returning 8% year over year, $$$

This plan is reasonably step-by-step, and it's pretty close to what any financial advisor will tell you to do

You don't need to understand everything about finance, since there's really only one high-return thing you need to focus on at any given time.
