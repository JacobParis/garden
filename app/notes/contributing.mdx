Documentation updates are one of the most accessible entrypoints into open source. The newer you are to a repository, the more context you have over where the shortcomings in the documentation are.

Core maintainers often don't have the time to keep docs updated, so helping out here is much appreciated.

If the docs are in markdown, Github allows you to edit them and submit pull requests without even manually forking. Simply navigate to the file in the repository and click the edit button.
